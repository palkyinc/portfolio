				<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
				<p>My name is Miguel Pereyra. I am a Systems Analyst and Electronic Technician. My greatest work experience has been in the IT-Infrastructure sector. For two years I have taken a turn towards web development. I consider myself self-taught, persevering and passionate in problem solving. I feel more comfortable working in a team, but I work on solo projects with no problems. My strongest skills are PHP and Laravel but I also have knowledge in other complementary technologies. I currently reside in Rio Grande, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina; My availability and interest is for remote jobs.</P>

					<h3>Slam (2020-2022)</h3>
					<a href="https://github.com/palkyinc/Comfueg" target="_blank">Go to the Github</a>
					<p>Description of the problem:</p>
					<p>This is a project that I did as a freelance without other participation, the goal is a web application for the administration of a small WISP. The main problem to solve was being able to manage and program Ubiquiti and Mikrotik equipment remotely and automatically, since it was done manually, which made the administration costly in time and with many possibilities for error. Other additional problems to solve were: registration of customer complaints, incidents and global technical debts; history of data traffic per customer, history of radio link status measurement, monitoring of links to providers, inventory and equipment history. Another important challenge was the hosting of the application, since it has to contact the teams to be programmed locally.</p>
					<p>Resolution:</p>
					<p>For the hosting I decided to use an HP proliant server with a Linux Alpine as the operating system. With Docker I created two containers, in one with Apache, in the other a MySQL server. The application was mainly developed with PHP-Laravel. The views were worked with Bootstrap, but I didn't focus too much on the visual aspect. Bandwidth consumption graphs are generated with the Chartisan plugin. I have designed some form views with Vue.js as I wanted them to be snappy and interactive for the operator. The views have been filtered by roles, and these are assigned to users. The information requests from the application to the Ubiquiti equipment are made through web services, but the programming is done with CLI sent by SSH. In the case of Mikrotik, all communication is carried out through the API offered by these devices. The application has a solution to disasters because the server is not in a cloud hosting. A backup of the database and the files that the system stores, such as images and data files generated by customer consumption, is made daily. The backup is compressed and stored daily in the cloud with a google drive account. A view was also made where the status of a client's radio link is tested, this occurs on demand, not automatically. The system generates emails with pending incident reports, link failures and a backup completion report. I have used the Git repository for the application wiki using Markdown.</p>
